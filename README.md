## Assignment 1: Trie with Linked Structure
1. Implements a trie using a linked structure (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).
2. Able to add words and find words.
3. Finds all words in the trie that contain the letters "ar". The letters must be contiguous in the word. For example, "hardware" does contain the letters "ar" contiguously but the word "batter" does not.
4. Prints out all words in the trie.

## Assignment 2: Binary Search Tree with Internal Iterator
1. Has internal iterator. The iterator accepts a lambda and evaluates the lambda on all of the elements in the tree.
2. Implement three strategies to order tree. First, sorts by Red Id. Second, sorts by the last name and then by the first name if the two last names are equal. Third, first round the GPA to the nearest integer, sorts by gpa, and when rounded gpa is equal sorts by Red Id.

## Assignment 3: Null Object Pattern and Visitor Pattern
1. Null Object pattern to add a null node to your tree to eliminate the need to check for null
references or pointers in your tree.
2. Visitor pattern. Implement two visitors, One to count the number of null nodes. Another is to
compute the longest path in the tree and the average path length in the tree.

## Assignment 4: Interpretor Pattern
Mini Turtle Language
